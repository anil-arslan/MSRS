    element pattern e.g. 120Â°
    monostatic multichannel debug.
    multistatic multichannel debug.
    multi TX de different transmitted power
    compressive sensing CFAR
    tek sample bandwidth sinc ile model reconstruction theory?
    resolution cell calculation, possible neighbours, cramer rao
    setintegrationindices neighbour table.
    TX seperation = time/frequency/waveform
    monostatic different frequency = FDA ?
    monostatic different waveform = MIMO ?
    Multi monostatic plot fusion
    Multi pulse.
    ghost target, mainlobe, tapering, fine sampling etc.

Extra
    integrated signal include pattern
    multistatic coherent processing relative phase and amplitude difference
    integration weights other processing algorithms (for L6 not important)
    BP, lsqr lasso, group lasso, fused lasso, adaptive lasso, prior lasso
    stagewise OMP, generalized OMP, multipath matching pursuit, elastic net

DONE
    Baseband processing added.
        It is assumed that superposed transmitted signals are resolved at receivers by their distinct carrier frequencies.
    Multi monostatic (it can be discussed)
    sinc based straddle loss
